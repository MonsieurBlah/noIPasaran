Description
-----------

[noIPasaran](http://noipasaran.eu01.aws.af.cm/) will be a web service written in Node.js that give you the most probable IP for the website you want to visit.
It will also check if your ISP is blocking the IP. If so, it will gives you the opportunity to overpass this censorship.

This is my final project in my bachelor degree. 

Since this project is due for June '13, it's still a work in progress.

What it does
------------

Nothing for the moment the online version is only used for testing purpose. 
Don't rely on anything you read there. 

The server is hosted by [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com).

The MongoDB database is hosted by [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com).

How it works
------------

If you clone the project and you wish to use this pre-alpha version, you must be insane.

Still, to run it, you must have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Once the installation complete, in the main directory, run :

	node site/index

And off you go !
