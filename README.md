Description
-----------

[noIPasaran](http://noipasaran.eu01.aws.af.cm/) will be a web service written in Node.js that give you the most probable IP for the website you want to visit.
It will also check if your ISP is blocking the IP. If so, it will gives you the opportunity to overpass this censorship.

This is my final project in my bachelor degree. 

Since this project is due for June '13, it's still a work in progress.

What it does
------------

The online version is only used for testing purpose. Don't rely on anything you read there.
For now it only does a simple resolve of the given URL. And it doesn't always do it well.
