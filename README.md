# noIPasaran


noIPasaran will be a web service that give you the most probable IP for the website you want to visit.
It will also check if your ISP is blocking the IP, based on a DNS server check. If so, it will gives you the opportunity to overpass this censorship.
Some additional features will be added along the way.

This is my final project in my bachelor degree. 

Since this project is due for June '13, it's still a work in progress.


## What it does

Not much for the moment. Be patient dear.


### What it's made of

+ [node.js][1]
+ [Express][2]
+ [Jade][3]
+ [Stylus][9]
+ [node-mysql][5]
+ [Bootstrap][4]
+ [Skeleton][6]

The database is hosted by [AlwaysData][7]

### How it works

If you clone the project, just don't yet.

Still, to run it, you must have [Node.js][1] installed.

You can install [nodemon][8], a great way to run node apps without stopping and starting each time you make a modification.

First install nodemon.

	npm install nodemon

Then run the app. Nodemon will know witch file to run based on the package.json

	nodemon

And off you go !
